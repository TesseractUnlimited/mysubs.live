# mysubs.live
### Repo for Tesseract Unlimited's mysubs.live client server

#### How to setup:
1. To install all the files needed rule `npm install`
2. To run the server, make your way to the `mysubs.live/client` directory and run `npm run dev`
##### Make sure nothing else is running on `port: 3000` on your machine at the same time this server is running

#### Before you commit and sync:
1. Make sure your `.gitignore` file has the text 'node_modules' in it so git knows not to sync that
