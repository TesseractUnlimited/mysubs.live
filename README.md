### How to update your branch properly:
1. Commit all your changes to your personal branch and sync up to your 'origin/<branch_name>'.
   ###### If you have any files you want to save, move them somewhere else or they will be rewritten or deleted!
2. Go to project root directory and run `git checkout master`.
3. Then run sync up your local 'master' branch with our 'origin/master' branch
   ###### **WARNING: There should be no changes going from your local 'master' branch to our 'origin/master' branch! All your work should have been done on your local branch. The only thing that should be changing is your local 'master' branch.**
4. Now run `git checkout <branch_name>`.
5. Then run `git merge master`.
